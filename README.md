# Web-Development Examination Project
This project was the examination project in the Web Development course in 2nd grade (Gymnasium/Upper Secondary).

The course only contained Front-End, which is why the back-end for this project is very simple and limited, and most of the focus was spent on the frontend.
However, the front-end for the project was focused on passing criteria for the course, and only consists of placeholder images and assets.
